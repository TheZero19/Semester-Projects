--If you've finally downloaded this project once again, I believe you've developed some courage for Unity Development again.

Here are the things you can work on:
Dungeon Platformer:
1. Can work on sound, colliders and checkpoints.
2. Save progress
3. Add more collectibles.

Sphere In Arms:
1. Use characters instead of spheres and capsules. Just don't be lazy to work on animations.
2. Improve the usage of Photon.
3. Create the options and settings menu as well, create a system to customize the input settings.
4. Work on particle system.
5. Rest of the flaws, you'll discover on your own as you work on this project.

Nalapani:
1. I don't know where to start. Just because the scale of the project can be so large that anything can be enhanced/added at this point.
2. Work on more animations.
3. Work on the story mode.
4. Can be made co-op but don't know how..
etc etc etc
