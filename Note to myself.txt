--If you've finally downloaded this project once again, I believe you've developed some courage for Unity Development again.

Here are the things you can work on:
1. Use characters instead of spheres and capsules. Just don't be lazy to work on animations.
2. Improve the usage of Photon.
3. Create the options and settings menu as well, create a system to customize the input settings.
4. Work on particle system.
5. Rest of the flaws, you'll discover on your own as you work on this project.
